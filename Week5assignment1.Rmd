## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
##Code for reading in the dataset and/or processing the data
df <- read.csv("activity.csv")
library(ggplot2)
install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)
##Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(df$steps, df$date)
days<-df$date
steps<- df$steps
stepsperday<- aggregate(steps, list(days), FUN=sum)
head(stepsperday)
hist(stepsperday$x, xlab = "Steps Per Day", main = "Histogram of Frequency of Steps per Day")
##Mean and median number of steps taken each day
mean(stepsperday$x, na.rm = TRUE)
median(stepsperday$x, na.rm = TRUE)
##Time series plot of the average number of steps taken
avgstepsperint <- df %>% filter(!is.na(steps)) %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarize(steps = mean(steps))
ggplot(avgstepsperint, aes(interval, steps)) + geom_line() + ggtitle("Average Steps per Inteveral")

##The 5-minute interval that, on average, contains the maximum number of steps
head(activity)
max(avgstepsperint$steps)
which(grepl(206.1698, avgstepsperint$steps))
avgstepsperint[104,]

##Code to describe and show a strategy for imputing missing data
missing <-is.na(df$steps)
sum(missing)
(sum(missing))/(length(avgstepsperint$steps))
complete<-df
complete$steps<- ifelse(is.na(complete$steps),avgstepsperint$steps[match(complete$interval,avgstepsperint$interval)],complete$steps)

##Histogram of the total number of steps taken each day after missing values are imputed
fullstepsperday<- aggregate(complete$steps, list(complete$date), FUN=sum)
hist(fullstepsperday$x, xlab = "Steps Per Day", main = "Histogram of Frequency of Steps per Day")
##Panel plot comparing the average number of steps taken per 5-minute interval across weekdays and weekends
dates<- as.Date(complete$date)
days<-weekdays(dates)
days<-ifelse(grepl("Saturday", days), "Weekend", days)
days<-ifelse(grepl("Sunday", days), "Weekend", days)
days<-ifelse(grepl("Monday", days), "Weekday", days)
days<-ifelse(grepl("Tuesday", days), "Weekday", days)
days<-ifelse(grepl("Wednesday", days), "Weekday", days)
days<-ifelse(grepl("Thursday", days), "Weekday", days)
days<-ifelse(grepl("Friday", days), "Weekday", days)
days<- as.factor(days)
complete<-cbind(complete,days)
intbydaytype <- complete %>% group_by(interval, days) %>% summarise(steps = mean(steps))
ggplot(intbydaytype, aes(x=interval, y=steps, color = days)) + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~days, ncol = 1, nrow=2)


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
